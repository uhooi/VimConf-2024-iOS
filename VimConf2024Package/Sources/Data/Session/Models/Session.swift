        This presentation will explore how to achieve a development experience superior to VSCode using Neovim. We‚Äôll cover LSP setup, AI-powered tools, and efficient workflows using macros, snippets, and terminal integration. Practical techniques and browser integration will be demonstrated in a live coding session, showcasing how Neovim can significantly boost productivity in modern frontend development.
